CHAPLIN MODELAGE
 
1. FIELD:
	1.1. HASH: Holds fields, can also save to the DB or to another field
		1.1.1. HASH: Many types of field per assoc name (normal, can be DB saved)
		1.1.2. ITERATOR: One type of field
			1.1.2.1. ASSOCIATIVE: is like key-based hashes
			1.1.2.2. INDEX: Holds many primitives (& is "Field" for array type)
	1.3. FIELD: Holds a primitive
	1.4. FIELD ID: Holds a primary key primitive which cannot be overwritten
2. MODEL:
    2.1. MODEL_ABSTRACT: Can be saved to the database, extend Hash.


HASH STORES:
	Data
	Add/Change (e.g. $set, $addToSet)
	Remove (e.g. $unset, $pull)

HOW TO GET DATA IN
Start with a primitive hash.
Iterate the allowed fields of the object they're going in.
If the hash has them set check their object type:
	HASH: createFromData(Data, This)
		will set fields
	ITERATOR: createFromData(Data, This)
		will iterate and then set fields
	FIELD, ID: createFromData(Data, This)

HOW TO GET DATA OUT
getArray()
	will get hash's array
		will get iterator's array
			will get field name => field

EXAMPLE
User hash
	User id
	Name field
	Comments index iterator
